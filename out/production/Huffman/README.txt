What kinds of file lead to lots of compressions.
Files such as .txt files lead to lots of compression. This is likely because .txt files have many
repeating characters. This allows for Huffman program to compress the file by replacing
the repeated characters with a new code derived from its frequency. This allows for significant
compression as a result.

What kind of files had little or no compression?
Files such as .tif files had little to no compression. This is likely because .tif files are a
file format used for storing images/graphics. Such files are more complex and don't have as much
repitition, making Huffman compression less effective.
